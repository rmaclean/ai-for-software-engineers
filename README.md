## Terminology

1. [AI](https://youtu.be/62acV11LwYw?t=1644) - is what you call your technology when it doesn't work, because when it does work, it gets a new name; it becomes image recognition, or translators, or large language models.
2. [Stochastic parrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot) - systems that statistically mimic text without real understanding
3. [Centaurs](https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/04/bad-vibe-coding/#maximally-codelike-bugs) - people assisted by machines
4. [Reverse-Centaurs](https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/04/bad-vibe-coding/#maximally-codelike-bugs) - eople conscripted into assisting machines
5. [Accountability sinks] - structures that absorb or obscure the consequences of a decision such that no one can be held directly accountable for it
